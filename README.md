# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course pre-work.
# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

---

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
Now fill in the details as much as you can, referring to the following tips as you go:

Remember that # in markdown is the top-level header, which is typically the title of the page. You can create your own title. For our example purposes, we will use ‚ÄúPrework Study Guide Webpage‚Äù.
  # Prework Study Guide Webpage
Next, ## in markdown is a subheading. We have several subheadings in this README.

For ## Description, write a short description of the Prework Study Guide Webpage. Use the guiding questions to help you.

We don't have a long README, so you can delete the ## Table of Contents section.

For ## Installation, we don‚Äôt have any steps to take to install anything for our webpage, so write ‚ÄúN/A‚Äù for this section.

For ## Usage, write a short paragraph about how this Prework Study Guide can be used. For example, you can write about how each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first. For now, we don't need to add an image, so you can delete that part.

For ## Credits, we didn‚Äôt collaborate with others nor did we use any third-party assets or tutorials, so we can write ‚ÄúN/A‚Äù.

For ## License, keep the MIT license that we chose when we first created the repository.

The rest of the sections don‚Äôt apply to us, but feel free to take a look.

Code Review
How did you do? Let‚Äôs take a moment to review what this might look like. Review the following example of the project README and compare your results:

# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.

## Credits

N/A

## License

Please refer to the LICENSE in the repo.
The content might differ slightly, but the format should look the same. A README is like a cover page to your GitHub repo and can be seen by anyone who looks at your GitHub projects. Therefore, it's important to take the time to create a well-written README for each project‚Äîespecially if you want to showcase your work to future employers. As you work on projects throughout the boot camp, you will get plenty of experience writing effective README files.

Let‚Äôs sync our GitHub repo with our current work. You've done this several times already, so try to remember the Git commands on your own for the following steps:

Add and commit your files, and make sure to include a commit message!

Pull in the base branch, main.

Push up your feature branch.

HINT
Good job! Now let's merge the feature branch into our main branch and close the GitHub issue by following these steps:

In your browser, navigate to the project repo in GitHub and refresh to see the changes.

Select the "Compare & pull request" button. Remember, GitHub will know if a push to the repo has been made recently and offers this selection for any new branch that was recently pushed up.

Double-check that the base branch is the main branch and the comparison branch is feature/project-README. Enter the name of the PR and a brief description of what changes this PR will introduce. Select the "Create pull request" button to create a new pull request.

Now open the PR we created and merge the comparison branch into the base branch by clicking the "Merge pull request" button. When prompted, confirm the merge request.

Next, go the the main branch in GitHub and verify that the changes to the README file have been made, as shown in the following image:
